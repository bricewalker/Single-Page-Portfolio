            <h2>About</h2>
               <p> 
                  My name is Brice Walker, and I am a data scientist. I'm also currently working as an addictions counselor for <a href="https://www.americanbehavioralhealth.org/">American Behavioral Health Systems</a>, where I maintain a caseload of roughly 15 individuals. I operate under state licensing in Washington. My treatment philosophy is a compassion-based, harm-reduction approach that is trauma informed and uses MI, DBT, CBT, and REBT. I received my B.S. from the University of Idaho in Psychology with a minor in Addictions Studies. I have a CDP with clinical supervision designation from the Washington State Department of Health.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I have been clean and sober since 03/14/2009. I currently serve on the board of directors for <a href="http://www.ddaoforegon.com">Dual Diagnosis Anonymous</a> and have been actively involved in the peer movement as both an advocate and as a provider. Although I am slowly retiring from my career in mental health, I continue to advocate for the involvement of people with lived experience in all areas in health systems organization and for the implementation of evidence based practices that move away from the over-reliance on the medical model in the psychiatric sciences. To learn more about the peer movement and efforts to bring evidence based practices and peer support services to mental health treatment, please visit <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com">Mad in America</a>. If you would like to support reformation efforts in mental health care, please visit the <a href="http://www.mentalhealthexcellence.org">Foundation for Excellence in Mental Health</a>, and If you'd like to get involved in efforts to bring a safe consumption space to Washington State, please check out <a href="http://www.defender.org/projects/vocal-wa">Vocal-WA</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I currently reside in Lakewood, Washington with my 4 year old son, Alexander, and our golden retriever, Lightning. I am a PNW native and my hobbies include cooking, hiking, music production, and web design.

                  I supervised all substance abuse treatment services for Providence of Idaho in Shoshone County, Idaho. I managed (intensive)outpatient programs for both adolescents and adults. Some of my accomplishments while at this position include obtaining a contract with the Shoshone County Drug Court, securing a grant (PWWIC) to get pregnant women and women with infant children funding for substance abuse treatment and related programs/referrals/costs (with myself named as the primary treatment provider/case manager for state funded patients in this population), and the development of an on-site substance abuse screening/assessment program with the Shoshone and Benewah County Jails. I also created the first and only ASAM level 2.1 IOP program for adolescents in Shoshone County. I supervised a team of 4 that included drug testers, case managers and community based psycho-social rehabilitation specialists. This program served roughly 40 adults and 10 adolescents at any given moment.

                  I worked as a substance abuse counselor at a 300-bed residential, co-ed, substance abuse treatment program. I managed a caseload of 12 adult males in a male-only, mixed-funding therapeutic community ward of the residential program. I provided all individual and group counseling services for all 12 clients on my caseload and provided case management and lecturing services for the rest of the ~120 clients in the mixed-funding ward. I also provided healthy behavior promotion and prevention services for this population. I was responsible for providing management for the therapeutic community. I taught cognitive restructuring techniques using T4C, MRT, REBT, Reality Therapy, and Choice Theory curricula. Some of my accomplishments while in this position include transitioning the program into the first therapeutic community outside of the prison system in Washington State, and transitioning the billing practices for state-funded clinets to the Apple Health System.
